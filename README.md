# Smart-Switch

Particle Photon app to control relays connected to a light and a heater.
See [Partner app](https://github.com/gallingern/Humidity-Temperature-Sunset) for humidity and temperature.

## Overview

![prototype](prototype.jpg "prototype")

I created this project for home automation.  We all have a tendency to stay up too late.  With lights that turn off at bedtime, it can help reinforce positive behavior.  I mimicked the behavior available on a Wemo smart switch that turns the lights on 30 minutes before sunset, and then turns them off at bedtime.  I also fade them on in the morning as an alarm.  

My other problem is that my apartmentâ€™s gas heater is in the living room.  In winter, the bedroom gets really cold at night.  I solved this problem by triggering a space heater in the morning before I wake up, based on a temperature sensor attached to a different Photon on the other side of the room (see partner app).
